## Performance Optimizations

The application has been optimized for better performance and a lightweight experience:

### Component Optimizations

1. **Feed Posts**
   - Implemented React memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Lazy loading of comments (only fetch when expanded)
   - Memoized callback functions with useCallback
   - Added image optimization with blur placeholders
   - Improved prop drilling with useCallback for event handlers

2. **Feed Component**
   - Added infinite scroll with Intersection Observer API
   - Optimized data fetching with pagination
   - Implemented proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Improved loading states and user feedback
   - Added useMemo for computed values

3. **Movie Carousel**
   - Added image optimization with blur placeholders
   - Throttled resize handlers to prevent excessive calculations
   - Memoized component parts to reduce re-renders

### API Optimizations

1. **Comment API**
   - Implemented MongoDB projections to only fetch required fields
   - Added pagination for comments to reduce payload size
   - Optimized database queries for better performance
   - Improved error handling with detailed status codes

2. **Authentication**
   - Optimized token verification process
   - Reduced number of database calls

### General Improvements

1. **Image Loading**
   - Added lazy loading for images outside the viewport
   - Implemented blur placeholders for better perceived performance
   - Properly sized images using the "sizes" attribute
   - Used Next.js Image optimization

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Reduced payload sizes with specific field selection
   - Implemented pagination to limit data transfer
   - Added better error handling to prevent unnecessary retries

These optimizations significantly reduce the application's load time, memory usage, and network traffic while maintaining all functionality.
